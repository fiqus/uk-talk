----

- Founded in 2011
- 16 software development cooperatives
- Distributed in different regions of the country, so we interact mostly in virtual way

Note: The federation arises from the need to organize and group together to develop joint strategies that allow us to strengthen our cooperatives through training in new technologies, organizational processes and business management.

----

## How we interact

- We share a mailing list
- Daily basis communication: Mattermost
- Virtual board meeting once a month (open to all members)
- Face-to-face meetings twice a year

Note: As our colleagues of the tech workers coalition say: "Show up! Because we value all forms of participation, but the most important way to participate is through in-person participation. We get things done by people showing up."

----

## Special areas in the federation

----

## FIC

- Technology training for specific projects
- Technology update in most used technologies in the market

----

## FIC Case study

- Client asks for more developers for his project
- There were no developers in the federation for that specific technology
- We managed to build a relationship of trust with the client
- They financed a course to train new cooperative developers

----

# FIT

### Space to share projects

----

## Some basic rules

- If you want to participate, you have to be a member of the federation
- You can be a FACTTIC member and not participate in FIT

Note: If you are not yet a formal co-operative, we allow the participation of pre-cooperatives with the goal of helping them to strengthen as they are formally constituted.
the strategy of encouraging the development of new cooperatives aims to increase the number of workers who take over their livelihoods.

----

## How we interact

- We have a monthly virtual meeting
- We share a special Mattermost channel

----

## Workflow introduction

- Cooperation instead of competition
- Many cases are possible
- Constantly improving this workflow

----

#### Workflow

### CASE 1: "WORKFLOW FOR EXPANSION"

A project demands more developers than the cooperative wants or can assign to the project

----

#### "WORKFLOW FOR EXPANSION"

- One client asks for more developers on the team
- Our cooperative cannot satisfy that need
- We communicate the request to the FIT to find the developers needed

Note: Perhaps because of a strategic issue or because of a specific technology 

----

#### "WORKFLOW FOR EXPANSION"

- If there are interested cooperatives, the candidates are evaluated
- If they qualify for the project and the client agrees, they can join the development team
- We explain to the client what intercooperation is and how we work in that way

Note: We explain to the client that the developer is from another cooperative

----

#### "WORKFLOW FOR EXPANSION"

- The commercial agreement and the coordination is carried out by only one cooperative

Note: Although several cooperatives could be working on the project, broadly speaking only one cooperative coordinates the project.

----

### CASE 2: "WORKFLOW TO DELEGATE A PROJECT"

A potential client requires development and for some reason we decide not to take it

----

#### "WORKFLOW TO DELEGATE A PROJECT"

- A job opportunity appears
- We decide we wont take the project
- We communicate it to FIT, specifying the request received

Note: Perhaps because of a strategic issue or because of a specific technology. We wait to see if there are co-operatives interested and available to take it

----


#### "WORKFLOW TO DELEGATE A PROJECT"

- If there is NO INTERESTED cooperative, then it means we don't have the availability to take it
- If there is one or more interested co-operatives, then the workflow is PUT INTO ACTION

----

#### "WORKFLOW TO DELEGATE A PROJECT"

### One interested party

- The contact is passed and they can continue with the client directly

----

#### "WORKFLOW TO DELEGATE A PROJECT"

### More than one interested party

  - If the project requires JUST ONE developer, it's given to the cooperative who needs it most
  - If the project requires MORE THAN ONE developer, the interested co-operatives manage the project as a team

# Next challenge

----

## How do we manage to build a similar model globally?

Note: Tech co-ops global network maybe?

----

### The following is the answer to this question, which will solve all the problems of the co-operative movement

----

<!-- .slide: data-background="./img/blue_screen.png" -->

Note: This model is based in trusted relationships between the cooperatives involved.

---

### Actually ... 


### We have to figure it out together

----

### Let's get together and do it
